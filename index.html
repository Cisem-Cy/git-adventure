    <p>It is a free and open source distributed version control system it allows us to create a timeline of our code</p>
    <h4>What's a branch and why do we create them?</h4>

    <h4>What's the working tree?</h4>
    <p>The working tree, or working directory, consists of files that you are currently working on. You can think of a working tree as a file system where you can view and modify files.</p>
    <h4>What's the staging area?</h4>
    <p>Staging area is files that are going to be a part of the next commit, which lets git know what changes in the file are going to occur for the next commit. </p>
